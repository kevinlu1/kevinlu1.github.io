        <p>You offer to help the pirate with the mutiny. The pirate stares at you confused.</p>

        <p> "YARR! NORMALLY, I'D HACK YE TO PIECES FOR MAKIN' SUCH A SCURVY JOKE, BUT I SUPPOSE WE BE NEEDIN' ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET! ALRIGHT YE' LAND LUBBER, I ACCEPT YE OFFER OF ASSISTANCE."</p>

        <p> The pirate leads you to a room, where a crowd of pirates have gathered, armed with guns and swords.</p>
        
        <p> "YARR! THIS BILGE RAT HERE HAS OFFER'D HIS ASSISTANCE IN OUR MUTINY. THE CAP'N AND HIS LACKEYS BE HOLE'D UP IN THE CAP'N'S QUARTERS! WE'LL MAKE THAT SALTY DOG WALK THE PLANK AT MIDNIGHT!</p>
        
        <p> The rest of the pirates cheer. You figure it's not too late to sneak away and find a way to escape. Or, you can stay and see what happens.</p>
