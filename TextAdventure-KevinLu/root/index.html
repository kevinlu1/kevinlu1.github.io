        <p>You awaken in the brig of a ship. Your hands have been tied up. It seems that you have been captured by pirates! Thankfully, it seems the pirates have done a poor job of tying you up. You break free easily!<br>

            <br>It's time to escape this ship! In front of you are two doors. Which one do you go through? </p>
