        <p>With a bit of luck, you are able to convince the pirate captain to surrender his ship peacefully. In exchange, the captain and his loyal crew are allowed to leave the ship unharmed on a rowboat. <br><br> Because of your exceptional negotiation skills, the pirates elect you as their new captain. You spend your new life sailing the seas and having adventures with your loyal crew. Although you are happy, you can't help but wonder what would have happened if you had escaped the ship.
        <br><br> YOU ARE THE NEW CAPTAIN!</p>
