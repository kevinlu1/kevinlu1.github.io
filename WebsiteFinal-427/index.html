            Denzel Curry is a rapper from Carol City, Florida. His latest EP, "Zuu", was a dark-yet-fun recount of
            life growing up in Carol City. For my final project, I wanted to create a visualizer that could represent
            Denzel in a music video or at a concert. I decided to use my knowledge of Blender to create a looping animation. The visualizer features Denzel's song Speedboat. The boat was designed to reflect Curry himselft, with camoflauge suggesting a combination of raggedness and street-style. The numbers 32 represent Denzel's first successful album, "32 Zel." The visualizer features a heavy prominence of gold, which Curry describes as his most prized possessions. Almost every asset was modeled and textured by myself, with the exception of the helicopter.
